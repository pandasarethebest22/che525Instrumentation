In class we put together a control panel and wired a coriolis flow meter, level transmitter, pressure transmitter, and RTD. Rose-Hulman uses DeltaV along with charm cards to relay information to and from the control system. I helped wire the coriolis flow meter during the installation day. The following table inclues instrumentation information:
| Instrument | Tag | Manufacturer | Model | Process Parameters |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| RTD | TE525A | Omega | 3-Wire Pt100 | Temperature |
| Pressure Transmitter | PIT525A | Endress + Hauser | Deltapilot S | Pressure |
| Level Transmitter | LIT525A | Endress + Hauser | Micropilot FMR63B | Level |
| Coriolis Flow Meter | FIT525A | Endress + Hauser | PromassF 300 | Mass Flow Rate, Temperature, Density |

Everything that was put on the control panel:
